==================================================================
This data analysis is based on the study mentioned below:**

=========================================
This analysis contains 2 datasets:

1. tidy_wearables.txt
A data set of 10.299 records. Each one describes the sensor data and the detected activity for 30 observation subject.

2. tidy_wearables_AVG.txt
A data set of 180 records. Each one describes the average of the sensor data for the detected activity per each of the 30 subjects. 

The activities are: 
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

Variables of both data sets.
